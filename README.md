## ChatZilla

ChatZilla is a chat application powered by Socket.IO, designed to provide real-time messaging capabilities for users. 

## Current Progress

- Initialised socket.IO events
- Developed a responsive chat interface 
- Tested the working of socket events on both client and server side
- Developed an interactive sign in page
- Configured MongoDB cloud and initialised collections: Message, Room and User on the server side
- Initialised routes and controllers
- Implemented JWT auth
- API tested all routes


***This project has limited functionality as of now (entry level functionality for socket.io) but I do plan to add more functionality like user auth, PWA compatibility, and chat storage***
